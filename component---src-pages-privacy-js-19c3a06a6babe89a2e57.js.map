Insufficient network fees may cause an\n          Inbound Transfer to remain in a pending state and may result in delays\n          or loss incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the\n          transaction.&nbsp; Reflexer Labshas no obligation to assist in the\n          remediation of such transactions.&nbsp; When you send Digital Currency\n          from your Reflexer LabsAccount to an external wallet (&ldquo;Outbound\n          Transfers&rdquo;), such transfers are executed on chain by you and not\n          under the control of Reflexer Labs. You should verify all transaction\n          information prior to submitting them. Reflexer Labsshall bear no\n          liability or responsibility in the event you enter an incorrect\n          blockchain destination address. Digital Currency Transfers cannot be\n          reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant Digital\n          Currency network, although they may be in a pending state, and\n          designated accordingly, while the transaction is processed by network\n          operators. Reflexer Labsdoes not control the Digital Currency network\n          and makes no guarantees that a Digital Currency Transfer will be\n          confirmed by the network.\n        </p>\n        <h2>5. FEES AND TAXES</h2>\n        <p className=\"subtitle\">5.1. Fees</p>\n        <p>\n          By using the Reflexer LabsServices you agree to pay all applicable\n          fees. Reflexer Labsreserves the right to adjust its pricing and fees\n          and any applicable waivers at any time. We will always notify you of\n          the pricing and fees which apply to your transaction when you\n          authorize the transaction and in each receipt we issue to you. Users\n          may be subject to a network fees (miner fees) to process a Digital\n          Currency Transaction when transferring Digital Currency to and from\n          their Reflexer LabsWallet. Bank fees, credit card and debit card fees\n          charged for any Digital Currency purchase may be netted out of the\n          settled amount of your Digital Currency purchases. You are responsible\n          for paying any additional fees charged by your financial service\n          provider. We will not process a purchase or sale if associated fees\n          exceed the value of the purchase or sale. You may be required to\n          deposit additional money to cover bank, credit card or debit card fees\n          if you desire to complete such a transaction.&nbsp; In addition,\n          Reflexer Labsearns fees on the interest rate spread (i.e., the\n          difference between the prevailing interest rate on the underlying\n          lender protocols and the interest rate that users of the Digital\n          Currency Wallet receive).\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"subtitle\">5.2. Taxes</p>\n        <p>\n          It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what\n          extent, any taxes apply to any interest received through the Reflexer\n          Labs Services, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct\n          amount of tax to the appropriate tax authorities.\n        </p>\n        <h2>6. RISK FACTORS</h2>\n        <p className=\"subtitle\">6.1. Investment Risk</p>\n        <p>\n          Interest rates for the Reflexer LabsServices are variable, meaning\n          they can fluctuate even after the user has deposited their Digital\n          Currency. As a result, the user may earn lower interest than the\n          interest rate reflected on the Site when first using a Reflexer\n          LabsAccount. Similarly, when using the Digital Currency Wallet, the\n          user may be responsible for paying a much higher interest rate than\n          when the user first borrowed Digital Currency through the Reflexer\n          LabsServices. Reflexer Labsis not responsible for these interest rate\n          fluctuations, which are based on a pre-set formula that Compound\n          manages.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"subtitle\">6.2. Borrower Default Risk</p>\n        <p>\n          When using a Reflexer LabsAccount, users fund a liquidity pool via\n          Compound from which other users may borrow which has certain borrower\n          default risk. When borrowing from that liquidity pool, borrowers must\n          post collateral, the value of which at the time of borrowing is\n          greater than the value of the Digital Currency they are borrowing\n          (i.e., borrowers are &ldquo;over-collateralized&rdquo;). Nevertheless,\n          if the value of the collateral that borrowers have posted rapidly\n          falls, there may be insufficient residual value of the collateral\n          value remaining to repay the loans these borrowers have taken, and in\n          turn the user of a Reflexer LabsAccount may lose some or all of the\n          user&rsquo;s initial amounts uploaded to the user&rsquo;s Reflexer\n          LabsAccount and/or the user&rsquo;s expected interest.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"subtitle\">6.3. Interest Rate Risk</p>\n        <p>\n          When using your Reflexer LabsAccount, note that interest rates on\n          Compound are variable, meaning they can fluctuate even after you have\n          deposited money or taken out a loan. This means that as a depositor\n          you may earn less than the interest rate you saw at the time you\n          deposited, or that as a borrower you will be responsible for paying a\n          much higher interest rate than you saw when you first borrowed money.\n          Reflexer Labsis not responsible for these interest rate fluctuations,\n          which are based on a pre-set formula that Compound manages. Further,\n          the interest rates reflected on this page are as of the current date\n          and time may change at any time, before or after the account is opened\n          on Reflexer Labs.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"subtitle\">6.4. No Insurance</p>\n        <p>\n          Digital currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government,\n          and digital currency accounts and value balances on Reflexer Labsare\n          not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities\n          Investor Protection Corporation protections. Reflexer Labsis not a\n          bank and does not offer fiduciary services.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"subtitle\">6.5. New Technical Risk</p>\n        <p>\n          Both the Reflexer Labssoftware and the Compound software used for your\n          Reflexer LabsAccount are new. While this software has been extensively\n          tested, the software used for the Reflexer LabsServices is still\n          relatively new and could have bugs or security vulnerabilities.\n          Further, the software is still under development and may undergo\n          significant changes over time that may not meet users&rsquo;\n          expectations.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"subtitle\">6.6. Risk of Reliance on Third Parties</p>\n        <p>\n          The Reflexer LabsServices rely in whole or partly, on third party\n          software and the continued development and support of third parties.\n          There is no assurance or guarantee that those third parties will\n          maintain their support of their software, which might have a material\n          adverse effect on the Reflexer LabsServices.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"subtitle\">6.7. Information Security Risk</p>\n        <p>\n          Digital Currency and use of the Reflexer LabsServices may be subject\n          to expropriation and/or theft. Hackers or other malicious groups or\n          organizations may attempt to interfere with the Reflexer LabsServices\n          in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks,\n          denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks,\n          smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Ethereum and Compound\n          platform rest on open source software, there is the software\n          underlying the Reflexer LabsServices may contain intentional or\n          unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the\n          Reflexer LabsServices or result in the loss of user&rsquo;s Digital\n          Currency, the loss of user&rsquo;s ability to access or control their\n          Reflexer LabsAccount. In the event of such a software bug or weakness,\n          there may be no remedy and users are not guaranteed any remedy, refund\n          or compensation.\n        </p>\n        <h2>7.
