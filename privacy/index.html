Bank fees, credit card and debit card fees charged for any Digital Currency purchase may be netted out of the settled amount of your Digital Currency purchases. You are responsible for paying any additional fees charged by your financial service provider. We will not process a purchase or sale if associated fees exceed the value of the purchase or sale. You may be required to deposit additional money to cover bank, credit card or debit card fees if you desire to complete such a transaction.  In addition, Reflexer Labsearns fees on the interest rate spread (i.e., the difference between the prevailing interest rate on the underlying lender protocols and the interest rate that users of the Digital Currency Wallet receive).</p><p class="subtitle">5.2. Taxes</p><p>It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any interest received through the Reflexer Labs Services, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amount of tax to the appropriate tax authorities.</p><h2>6. RISK FACTORS</h2><p class="subtitle">6.1. Investment Risk</p><p>Interest rates for the Reflexer LabsServices are variable, meaning they can fluctuate even after the user has deposited their Digital Currency. As a result, the user may earn lower interest than the interest rate reflected on the Site when first using a Reflexer LabsAccount. Similarly, when using the Digital Currency Wallet, the user may be responsible for paying a much higher interest rate than when the user first borrowed Digital Currency through the Reflexer LabsServices. Reflexer Labsis not responsible for these interest rate fluctuations, which are based on a pre-set formula that Compound manages.</p><p class="subtitle">6.2. Borrower Default Risk</p><p>When using a Reflexer LabsAccount, users fund a liquidity pool via Compound from which other users may borrow which has certain borrower default risk. When borrowing from that liquidity pool, borrowers must post collateral, the value of which at the time of borrowing is greater than the value of the Digital Currency they are borrowing (i.e., borrowers are “over-collateralized”). Nevertheless, if the value of the collateral that borrowers have posted rapidly falls, there may be insufficient residual value of the collateral value remaining to repay the loans these borrowers have taken, and in turn the user of a Reflexer LabsAccount may lose some or all of the user’s initial amounts uploaded to the user’s Reflexer LabsAccount and/or the user’s expected interest.</p><p class="subtitle">6.3. Interest Rate Risk</p><p>When using your Reflexer LabsAccount, note that interest rates on Compound are variable, meaning they can fluctuate even after you have deposited money or taken out a loan. This means that as a depositor you may earn less than the interest rate you saw at the time you deposited, or that as a borrower you will be responsible for paying a much higher interest rate than you saw when you first borrowed money. Reflexer Labsis not responsible for these interest rate fluctuations, which are based on a pre-set formula that Compound manages. Further, the interest rates reflected on this page are as of the current date and time may change at any time, before or after the account is opened on Reflexer Labs.</p><p class="subtitle">6.4. No Insurance</p><p>Digital currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and digital currency accounts and value balances on Reflexer Labsare not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections. Reflexer Labsis not a bank and does not offer fiduciary services.</p><p class="subtitle">6.5. New Technical Risk</p><p>Both the Reflexer Labssoftware and the Compound software used for your Reflexer LabsAccount are new. While this software has been extensively tested, the software used for the Reflexer LabsServices is still relatively new and could have bugs or security vulnerabilities. Further, the software is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time that may not meet users’ expectations.</p><p class="subtitle">6.6. Risk of Reliance on Third Parties</p><p>The Reflexer LabsServices rely in whole or partly, on third party software and the continued development and support of third parties.

Information Security Risk</p><p>Digital Currency and use of the Reflexer LabsServices may be subject to expropriation and/or theft. Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Reflexer LabsServices in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Ethereum and Compound platform rest on open source software, there is the software underlying the Reflexer LabsServices may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the Reflexer LabsServices or result in the loss of user’s Digital Currency, the loss of user’s ability to access or control their Reflexer LabsAccount. In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy and users are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.</p><h2>7.
